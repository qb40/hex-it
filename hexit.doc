HexIt is a binary editor, usually refered to as a hexeditor. The main
difference between a regular texteditor and a hexeditor is that a
texteditor translates some bytes to tabs, linefeeds, carriage returns,
etc or simply ignores them. A hexeditor does no such thing, instead it
prints the hexadecimal value of the byte. Most hexeditors have a
textfield as well, where you'll see all sorts of funny-looking faces and
arrows. ;)

You should use a hexeditor if you're planning to alter something in a
binary file, e.g an exe-file. But on the other hand, why would anyone
want to do that? <g>

Umm... *cough* I've come to understand that I'm not the best of
doc-writers. If you feel there's something missing in this file, why
don't you email me and tell me so? Feel free to write/rewrite a portion
of the doc yourself and send it to me. If I like your work, I'll include
it in this file and give you credits for it. I do of course reserve the
right to reject your changes, add spelling- and/or grammatical errors to
them or do some other nasty thing that comes to mind. Come now folks,
don't be afraid. Here's your chance to do something useful with your
life! ;)

ş 80386 or better.

ş MS-DOS 3.0 or higher, or some other OS that is capable of running such
  files. (MS-DOS version only)

ş An OS capable of running win32 binaries. (Win32 version only)

ş A VGA card would be great.

ş A mouse if you wish to utilize the mouse-support.

ş Some low memory for the program to run in, approx 209KB (MS-DOS
  version only). Extra memory is used for files and clipboard. The more
  you have, the better off you are. The win32 version currently
  allocates memory in 1 meg chunks, so you'll need at least that amount.
  Since you can't even dream of being able to run a win32 exe with less
  than 4 meg - perhaps more - this shouldn't be much of a problem.

ş Calculator

ş Built-in assembler! Press <tab> in CodeMode.

ş Recording and playback of macros.

ş Built-in disassembler! Check out CodeMode inside HexIt ( <F4> is the
  default key for choosing mode ).

ş 80x25/28/43/50/60 textmode hexeditor. HexIt starts up in the videomode
  you used when starting the program if it is one of the above, else it
  uses 80x25. This is of course fully configurable, you can choose to
  start in e.g 80x50 if you want to. But then again, you're always in
  80x50 anyway, aren't you? The win32 version can startup with any
  number of lines as long as it's not more than 140.

ş Supports 100 files in memory at the same time.

ş Files may be as big as your total amount of free memory. Virtual
  memory can be used in the win32 version.

ş SplitScreen facilities.

ş Editing. Yes! =)

ş Preserves your "pre-HexIt" videomode, and initializes your favourite
  80x12 textmode (or whatever you use) upon exit if you so desire...

ş Deleting bytes and thereby shrinking the file.

ş Inserting bytes and thereby expanding the file. You can also set the
  Insert/Overwrite toggle to Insert, and then type whatever you like,
  HexIt will push the rest of the file forward for you.

ş Clipboard (maximum size equals your free mem minus the total size of
  your loaded files) with cut, copy and paste!

ş Goto fileoffset, both absolute and relative.

ş Hex/ASCII search- and replace-facilities. Forwards/Backwards, all
  files/one file, etc.

ş Online help.

ş Ability to view files as a normal textviewer would.

ş This entire file is loaded and displayed if you press Alt+H.
  Functionkeys are always explained at the bottomrow.

ş Create new files simply by giving their name as an argument.

ş Compare two files. Read more about it further down.

ş A setup mode where you can alter colours, configure keys etc.

ş Mousesupport! Scroll the screen using your mouse. Define what HexIt
  will do when a specific mouse-button is pressed!

ş Supports wildcards when loading files, thus
  "HexIt gunde.* gnu ka??.txt" is perfectly valid.

ş EXE-header info.

				ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
				³Gray -³
				ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
This key removes the marked block from the file and puts it in the
clipboard.

				ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
				³Gray +³
				ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
Does the same as "Gray -", except it doesn't remove the block from the
file.

				ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
				³Gray *³
				ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
The clipboard is inserted at the current position if the
Insert/Overwrite toggle is set to Insert, else it overwrites the data
starting at the current position.

			      ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
			      ³BackSpace³
			      ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
Textfield
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Puts a zero at the preceeding byte and decreases your offset in the
file. Note that if the Insert/Overwrite toggle is set to Insert, then
pressing backspace will move the rest of the file (including your
position) backwards one byte. This is the same as pressing CursLeft
followed by DELete.

Hexfield
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Puts a zero at the preceeding nibble and decreases your offset in the
file by one nibble. Note that if the Insert-toggle is on and you are
positioned over a high nibble, then the rest of the file will be moved
one byte backwards.

				ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
				³INSert³
				ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
This key toggles the Insert/Overwrite toggle. If you are in Insert-mode,
then the file will automatically move forward one byte when typing in
the texfield (and every second keypress in hexfield). The result will be
the same as if you pressed ALT+I, and then typed whatever it was.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³F1³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
Pressing F1 will pop up a menu from where you can go several ways, this
is the helpsystem. The first time you press F1, you are taken to the
"Help MainMenu" and from there you can navigate through the helpsystem
by using the Cursorkeys and <Enter>. Pressing <Esc> will exit the
helpsystem and store your current menu. Thus, the next time you press
F1, you will start right where you exited. You can also use the first
letter of the desired option to select it. E.g in this menu

ÚÄÄÍ Faked Menu ÍÄÄ¿
³ Back to MainMenu ³
³ Exit this menu   ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

you could press 'B' to go back to the mainmenu, but using the Cursorkeys
and <Enter> to select the first option would produce the same result.

				  ÚÄ¿
				  ³W³
				  ÀÄÙ
This key toggles between Wrapped and Unwrapped lines in textmode. When
Unwrapped, the lines have a maximum width of 999 characters. After that
the line is cut and continued on the next line.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³F3³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
This key invokes a popupmenu where you select which file to edit (among
the ones already loaded). Use CursUp/Down to scroll through the list and
CursLeft/Right to see more if all files won't fit in one menu. You can
also use the functionkeys to select.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³F5³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
[HexMode]
Pressing this key will popup a menu prompting you for an offset to go
to. You can prefix the value with a plus- or minus-sign to make a
relative jump.

[TextMode]
You will be prompted for a linenumber to go to. If you prefix the number
with a minus or a plus, HexIt will jump up/down X lines.


				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³F6³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
[HexMode]
Displays the EXE-header and lets you do the following:
 o  Edit it directly
 o  Calculate valid values at offset 2 and 4
 o  Goto start of relocation-table
 o  Goto SS:SP
 o  Goto image (directly after exe-header)
 o  Goto the programs entrypoint

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³F7³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
This key takes you to the search function. You are then given the
opportunity to change a few things about the search, they are marked
with an [X] if they are in use. The options are:

START AT BOF	If ON, the search starts at BOF (EOF if BACKWARDS is
		ON), otherwise HexIt starts searching from the current
		position.

IGNORE CASE	ON means don't care about upper or lower case.

ALL FILES	ON means search for the string in all loaded files. Note
		that this option always searches from the beginning of
		the file, overriding the START AT BOF setting.

BACKWARDS	ON means search/replace backwards.

You move between these options and the two "write-fields" with CursUp
and CursDown, toggle the options by pressing space. There are, as I
said, two fields in which you can type the string to search for. The
first is an ASCII-field, in which you type the text as in an ordinary
texteditor. The other one is a hex-field where you write the string to
search for in hexadecimal digits.

Also note, that if you have previously searched for a string, this
string will still be there when you enter the search-function for the
next time. The different toggles are saved as well. Simply start writing
to discard the previous string, or press BackSpace, CursLeft or
CursRight to continue editing the current string. Pressing ESC while in
the search-function takes you back to the file-editing, it also discards
any string written in any of the search-fields. To start searching,
simply press <Enter>.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³F8³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
Pressing F8 takes you to the replace-function. The different options in
this "menu" is basically the same as those for searching, except:

ASK FIRST	ON gives you the opportunity to choose which ocurrences
		to replace. That is, it will bring up a menu saying
		"Replace this?", thus asking you to select one of these
		options:

			YES	Replaces the current ocurrence
			NO	Does NOT replace the current ocurrence
			REST	Replaces all ocurrences with no further
				questions
			QUIT	Quit replacing

		Off means that it automagically replaces ALL ocurrences

You are also presented with two more inputfields (compared to those when
searching). You are supposed to type in the string to replace WITH here.
The four inputfields are named "S-ASC", "S-HEX", "R-ASC" and "R-HEX",
where "S" stands for "Search" and "R" for "Replace". Just press <Enter>
to start searching for matches to replace.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³F9³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
Enter an expression and see its result in dec, hex, oct and bin. Valid
suffixes are d,h,o and b. Valid operators are -,+,*,/,**,<<,>>,^,& and |.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³^C³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
When pressing Ctrl+C, HexIt will do a filecompare using the last
settings you specified. If you have not previously chosen comparemode,
you will be prompted to do so.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³^L³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
Use this key to search for the next matching string or replace it
(depending on what you last used). If you have not previously typed in a
string to search for, you will be guided to the
"type-in-the-string-to-search-for-menu". =)

				 ÚÄÄÄ¿
				 ³^F1³
				 ÀÄÄÄÙ
This will bring up a popup-menu asking you to choose a videomode. Your
current videomode will be the default choice.

				 ÚÄÄÄ¿
				 ³^F3³
				 ÀÄÄÄÙ
[HexMode]
Ctrl+F3 takes you to the file-compare menu (assuming you have two or
more files loaded). If you're already in splitscreen mode and has two
different files in the windows, you will directly be prompted to choose
compare-mode but more of that later. Else you will be presented with a
list of files in which you shall choose the file to compare your present
one with. However, if you only have two files loaded HexIt will
automagically use them.

Choosing compare-mode
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
You may choose between eight different modes:
Search for difference:
	From file-beginnings
	Forward from current position
	Backward from current position
	From file-endings

Search for similarity:
	From file-beginnings
	Forward from current position
	Backward from current position
	From file-endings

I think they are all pretty self-explanatory. The first four stops
comparing as soon as the two files differ from each other while the last
four stops when two bytes are the same.

[CodeMode]
Brings up the "CM comments on immediate values?" menu. From here you can
select how extensive commenting you want CM to perform when an
instruction involves immediate data. "None" never shows any comments.
"Some" shows comments for MOV, ADD, SUB, PUSH and CMOV. "All" shows
comments for all instructions involving immediate data.

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³@A³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
This will drop a marker at the current fileoffset. After putting two
markers, you can cut or copy the marked block. ( You don't have to put
the 2:nd marker if you're feeling lazy... ;)

				  ÚÄÄ¿
				  ³@U³
				  ÀÄÄÙ
This clears all markers. Note however, that the clipboard is not altered
in any way, the copied/cut block is still there, just waiting for you to
paste it... :)

Yes, you can use your mouse to scroll the screen! Just slide it up and
down and the world will slide with you... :) You can also adjust the
speed of your mouse-scroll, there are separate speeds for TextMode and
HexMode.

You can also define your mousebuttons to do whatever (almost) you like!
Even here there are separate configurations for TextMode and HexMode.

Just press Ctrl+F9 to enter the setup-menu, then choose "Mouse" to start
configuring the options regarding your mouse!

If you for any reason would not like to use your mouse, you can always
just leave it alone on the desk or turn off the mouse in the setup.

If starting HexIt takes a long time I suggest you try to find another
mouse-driver! Some of them take ages to initialize the mouse while
others are pretty smooth. If it still takes long time to start and you
don't use your mouse in HexIt, I suggest you remove mousesupport in the
config ("Use mouse-support?").

HexIt reacts to a few arguments given on the commandline. These are:
-file X 	= file that args affect (1 = first)
-win X		= window that args affect (1 = first)
-ss X		= splitscreen (0 = off, 1 = on)
-vm X		= viewmode (1 = TextMode, 2 = HexMode, etc.)
-o X		= go to offset X
--		= interpret the rest of the cmdline as filenames

"win" and "file" both defaults to 1.
An example might be in order here. The commandline
	"hexit hexit.exe -vm 3 -win 2 -vm 2 -ss 1 -- -gnu"
would start HexIt in splitscreen with DumpMode in the upper window and
HexMode in the lower window with two files loaded, "hexit.exe"
and "-gnu".

By pressing Ctrl+F9 you will enter the setup mode. From there you can
change the available options, such as the colours, keys, whether HexIt
should autodetect the videomode at startup and so on.

When saving the setup, HexIt writes to a file called HEXIT.CFG. It
automagically checks where your HEXIT.EXE (or whatever absurd name
you've decided to give it) is situated, and creates/updates the
config file there. Every time you start HexIt, it searches that
directory for a file called HEXIT.CFG. If it finds such a file, Hexit
reads the configfile and uses those options, otherwise it will use the
standard options.

Note that it does not matter if you are in the same directory as
HEXIT.EXE. Therefore it is fully acceptable, and advisable, to put
HEXIT.EXE in a directory to which your PATH-variable points. Because of
the fact that there is a separate cfg file, you can use your old config
with any version of HexIt (not versions before 0.94á though). You can
even use a configfile from the latest version of HexIt with an older
one.

HexIt will of course only accept options that the current version
supports. If you e.g have a configfile from v234.42 (Yeah! =) ) and try
to use it with HexIt 0.94á, you will only be able to use the options
that 0.94á supports. Don't worry about this though, HexIt takes care of
all that.

The exe file is getting bigger and bigger everyday and so is the source
code. Right now it's 653KB and 31400 lines long. Btw, HexIt is coded in
100% pure 32-bit asm. Well, I _could_ have coded my INT 24h-handler in
16-bit asm... :)

This info applies only to the win32 port, and only when running NT: I
was perplexed by the fact that HexMode was a lot slower than the other
modes. After some fiddling I've come to realize that the speed of the
console output routines in Windows depend greatly on how varied the
colour attributes are. Little variance makes for great speed; great
variance makes for little speed. I therefore recommend that you set the
"Background" colour in HexMode to the same colour as "Hexfield
(normal)". Try it out if you think HexMode is sluggish. Some speedups
can be made in CodeMode and DumpMode as well by altering their
background colours. Note: versions after v1.54 have these colours
configured correctly per default.

Please send me a letter, email or whatever if you find an annoying bug
or maybe just want to ask me something or don't want anything special at
all for that matter! It would be REALLY fun to see how far out in the
world my little HexIt reaches. Please send me some email! Yiihaa! I've
gotten emails from loads of ppl now, thank you all! Keep 'em coming! ;)

You move around in the popup-menus with the Cursorkeys. You can however
often just press the first letter of the chosen sentence, or in some
cases press one of the functionkeys.

Hmm... INT 21h,60h doesn't seem to work very well with CD-ROM-drives. I
don't know whether it's MSCDEX or whatever that does it, but it doesn't
work anyway. Anybody's got any suggestions?
Anyway, because of this you may not see the full pathname of the file
you are editing on the upper row (you should see everything but the
driveletter though). If you explicitly specified a path when you loaded
the file, you'll still see that one.
Note that this only applies to files on CD-ROMs. The problem depends on
what CD-driver you've got. My driver works great under win95 but not
under MS-DOS.

To obtain the latest version of HexIt, just go to my homepage and
download it from there! See further down for addresses.

A quarter of a quadword is always more than a few bits of a byte in case
you didn't know.

I no longer have a betatester running OS/2 2.1, so I have absolutely no
idea whether HexIt works under it or not. So please, if you run OS/2
2.1, will you contact me and tell me what happens?

If something's not totally clear to you, try reading WHATSNEW.*, it
contains _lots_ of goodies not found anywhere else on this planet! ;)
There are quite a few things in there that probably belong in this file.

Aah yes, a good, bug-reporting fellow <hint, hint> named Andr‚s
Mazzocchi has informed me that HexIt will crash if you try to change
it's videomode when running in a _windowed_ MS-DOS shell under Windows
3.1. My suggestion: don't run it in a windowed MS-DOS shell under
Windows 3.1. Got that? ;)

If HexIt behaves a bit oddly (read "crashes violently") and you fail to
understand why, try deleting HEXIT.CFG and see if it helps.

Think HexIt's slow? Read the "Notes" section in this document for some
speed info pertaining to the win32 version.
